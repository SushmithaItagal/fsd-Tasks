2.No, constructors cannot be inherited in Java.

In inheritance sub class inherits the members of a super class except constructors.

In other words, constructors cannot be inherited in Java therefore, there is no need to write final before constructors.

Example
public interface InterfaceTest {
   public InterfaceTest(){
   }
   public abstract void display();
   public abstract void show();
}
Still, if you try to write constructors in an interface it will generate a compile time error.

4.The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.

Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).


MAPS
A map contains values on the basis of key, i.e. key and value pair. Each key and value pair is known as an entry. A Map contains unique keys.
A Map is useful if you have to search, update or delete elements on the basis of a key.
There are two interfaces for implementing Map in java: Map and SortedMap, and three classes: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap
