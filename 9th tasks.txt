3.  Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a "strict" operating context. This strict context prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions.

And:

Strict mode helps out in a couple ways:

It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions.
It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively "unsafe" actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object).
It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out.


4.The <noscript> tag defines an alternate content for users that have disabled scripts in their browser or have a browser that doesn't support script.

The <noscript> element can be used in both <head> and <body>.

When used inside the <head> element: <noscript> must contain only <link>, <style>, and <meta> elements.

The content inside the <noscript> element will be displayed if scripts are not supported, or are disabled in the user's browser.

8.  A JavaScript function can also be defined using an expression.

A function expression can be stored in a variable:

Example
var x = function (a, b) {return a * b};

12.  Flexbox can optionally wrap. If we allow a flex container to wrap, they will wrap down onto another row when the flex items fill a row. Where they line up on the next row is independent of what happenned on the first row, allowing for a masonry-like look.

Grid can also optionally wrap (if we allow auto filling) in the sense that items can fill a row and move to the new row (or auto place themselves), but as they do, they will fall along the same grid lines all the other elements do.
